# Natural Gas Demand Prediction
In the era of growth and industrialization, Fossil fuel sources
are exhausting and discovered day by day. To maintain a
healthy environment for future generations, reduction in
Carbon-dioxide (CO2) emission is an important step.
Since the world cannot be fully dependent on renewable
energy resources, we need to focus on non-renewable
resources which are less harmful to the environment. Natural
and petroleum gas is such a great option to fulfill the
demands of the industries as well as other energy-consuming
stakeholders. International Energy Agency (IEA) report
published in October 2021 shows that unplanned supply
outages of natural gas and strong recovery in demand led to
higher gas prices. In past decades, the consumption of
natural gas has seen continuous growth globally. But due to
COVID19, there was a decrease in consumption, and supply
was not adjusted according to demand which brings new
opportunities and challenges to the global gas systems.

Therefore, it is essential to have forecasting of natural
gas demand for sustainable development of countries. It can be
observed from the Figure that gas consumption is rising since
1990 from 2058 bcm (Billion Cubic Meters) to 3952 bcm in
2020.
